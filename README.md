# FPGA_Sobel_Edge_Detection
In progress: The project involves transmitting an image from a computer to an FPGA via UART serial communication, followed by Sobel edge detection using a convolution module. The resulting image is then stored in block RAM before being displayed on a VGA monitor. Future plans involve integrating an OV7670 camera module for real-time image capture and edge detection.
